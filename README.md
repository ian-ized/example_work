The jupiter notebook is a file used in my most recent project at the Golden Lab. It combines the schedule of the experiment,
positional data from a machine learning model trained by many late nights annotating, and the video itself to visualize the 
subject, its points of  interest, and its gaze. The visualizaition was made using this data. Videos of the mouse were not provided
as they are the property of the lab.
